## How It Works

Behind the scenes, HeatCheckr crunches hundreds of data points from NBA box scores, team records, and player stats. It applies custom algorithms to:

- Detect comeback wins, clutch moments, and statistical anomalies.
- Weigh team context (standings, rivalries, tanking, playoff implications).
- Score games using a multi-tier excitement model (from 💀 to 💎).
- Assign dynamic labels for easy filtering and discovery.
